Forms
=====

Super simple CSS for HTML Form Elements. 


What is it?
-----------

`gallerycss-cssform` is a [YUI Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/) module that makes it easy to style HTML form elements by just adding class names. Take a look at the [docs](http://tilomitra.github.com/cssforms/) for some examples.


What about older browsers?
--------------------------

Since it's all CSS, nothing breaks in older browsers. This module is tested on IE6+, Chrome, FF and Safari. For best results, use IE8+. IE6 and 7 have some minor vertical alignment issues for certain forms.


Dependencies
------------

* [normalize.css 1.x](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/)
* [cssbutton](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/button/#usecssbutton) if you wish to adopt the default button styles.
