Grids
=====

This foundational grid provides a simple system for layout out content. The
basic components are "grids" and "units". A "grid" (pure-g) contains one or
more "units" (pure-u). The type of "unit" chosen describes how it should be
sized (e.g. "pure-u-1-2" takes up half the grid, "pure-u-1-3" takes up
one-third, et cetera). The only constrains for Pure Grids are that all "units"
are children of a "grid".
