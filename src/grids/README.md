CSS Grids Utility
===============

Note: The file "grids.css" is deprecated, use "cssgrids.css" instead.

The foundational CSS Grids provides a simple system for layout out content. The
basic components are "grids" and "units". A "grid" (yui3-g) contains one or
more "units" (yui3-u). The type of "unit" chosen describes how it should be
sized (e.g. "yui3-u-1-2" takes up half the grid, "yui3-u-1-3" takes up
one-third, et cetera). The only constrains for YUI3 Grids are that all "units"
are children of a "grid".
