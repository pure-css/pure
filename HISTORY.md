NEXT
----

[#143]: https://github.com/yui/pure/issues/143

0.2.1 (2013-07-17)
------------------

### Forms

* (!) Made `[readonly]` `<input>`s look visually different to `[disabled]` and
  regular `<input>`s. ([#102][]: @jaseg)

* Fixed copy/paste bug that mapped text inputs to `.pure-form` instead of
  `.pure-group`. The `.pure-form-group input` styles are now applied to all
  text-ish `<input>` elements. ([#96][])

* Fixed `.pure-input-rounded` styles to now apply correctly. The change to use
  more specific selectors for text-ish inputs in v0.2.0 caused the
  `.pure-input-rounded` selector to not apply because it was less specific. This
  selector now has right specificity. ([#109][]: @AurelioDeRosa)

* Added `display: block` to `<textarea>`s in `.pure-form-stacked` `<form>`s to
  fix an alignment issue for subsequent elements. ([#90][]: @AurelioDeRosa)

* Removed the gray `color` from `.pure-form label`. This allows `<label>`s to
  inherit their foreground color. ([#89][]: @AurelioDeRosa)

### Grids

* (!) Changed `.pure-u-1` grid unit to now use `width: 100%` instead of
  `display: block` to achieve taking up the full width of its container. This
  makes it easier to override and align since it's using `display: inline-block`
  like the other grid units. ([#94][])

* Fixed `width` value typo in `.pure-u-1-6`, changed it from `16.656%` to
  `16.666%`. ([#115][]: @chilts)

### Menus

* (!) Fixed broken styling of active paginator items by using Grids CSS rules to
  layout items horizontally; this makes sure the active item isn't overlapped.
  ([#127][])

### Tables

* Removed `white-space: nowrap` from `.pure-table thead`. This fixes issues
  where tables inside of grids would break the grid. ([#95][]: @AurelioDeRosa)

0.2.0 (2013-06-11)
------------------

* (!) Fixed accessibility mistake by removing `a:focus {outline: none;}` rule
  from `buttons-core.css`.

* (!) Improved `:focus` styles by applying the same rules that are used by
  `:hover` styles. When overriding Pure's `:hover` styles, be sure to include
  `:focus` selectors as well.

* Added improvements to developer workflow:

    * Added basic Tests using CSSLint via `grunt test` ([#25][])

    * Integrated Travis CI which runs `grunt test` on pushes to `master` and for
      pull requests.

    * Added `grunt watch` task which runs tests and build.

    * Added support to `pure-site` for serving `pure` locally during
      development. ([#46][], [yui/pure-site#111][])

* Removed vendor prefixes for `box-shadow`, `text-shadow`, `border-radius`. All
  modern browsers support the non-prefixed versions of these properties.
  ([#23][])

### Forms

* (!) `.pure-help-inline` has been replaced with `.pure-form-message-inline`. We
  still support the older classname but it is deprecated and will be going away
  in a future release. ([#32][]: @dannytatom)

* Added a new class called `.pure-form-message`. It works the same way as
  `.pure-form-message-inline` but is meant for block elements.
  ([#32][]: @dannytatom)

* Added focus styles for file, radio, and checkbox `<input>`s to improve
  accessibility. ([#42][]: @codepb)

* `<textarea>`s now have the same styling as `<input>`s. ([#49][]: @rcbdev)

* `.pure-form input` rules are now more specific by targetting only "texty"
  `<inputs>`. This prevents these styles from affecting "buttony" `<input>`s.
  ([#54][])

### Grids

* Elements with classnames before the responsive grid's unit classnames now
  works correctly. Before units were targeted using the `^=` ("starts with")
  selector, which meant that if another classname preceded the unit classname,
  then the rule would not apply. ([#44][])

### Menus

* Added `.pure-menu-separator` classname that can be used to visually
  separate horizontal menu items. ([#53][]: @codepb, @mseri)

* Focused menus have an `outline: none` by default. Instead, menu-items that
  have been opened to display children (in a drop-down menu) get a slight
  background (`#dedede`) for accessibility. ([#22][])
