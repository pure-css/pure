![Build Status](https://github.com/pure-css/pure/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

## Features

Pure is a starting point for every website or web app. We take care
of all the CSS work that every site needs without making it look cookie-cutter:

- A responsive grid that can be customized to your needs.

- A solid base built on [Normalize.css][] to fix cross-browser compatibility
  issues.

- Consistently styled buttons that work with `<a>` and `<button>` elements.

- Styles for vertical and horizontal menus, including support for dropdown
  menus.

- Useful form alignments that look great on all screen sizes.

- Various common table styles.

- An extremely minimalist look that is super-easy to customize.

- Responsive by default, with a non-responsive option.

- Extremely small file size: **3.7KB minified + gzip**.

## Get Started

Check out the [Get Started][started] page for more information.

## Build From Source

Optionally, you can build Pure from its source on Github. To do this, you'll
need to have Node.js and npm installed. We use [Grunt][] to build Pure.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:pure-css/pure.git
cd pure
npm install
grunt
```

### Build Files

Now, all Pure CSS files should be built into the `pure/build/` directory. All
files that are in this build directory are also available on the CDN. The naming
conventions of the files in the `build/` directory follow these rules:

- `[module]-core.css`: The minimal set of styles, usually structural, that
  provide the base on which the rest of the module's styles build.

- `[module]-nr.css`: Rollup of `[module]-core.css` + `[module].css` +
  `[module]-[feature].css` from the `src/[module]/` dir. This is the
  non-responsive version of a module.

- `[module].css`: Rollup of `[module]-nr.css` + `[module]-r.css` from the
  `build/` dir. This is the responsive version of a module.

- `*-min.css`: A minified file version of the files of the same name.

- `pure.css`: A rollup of all `[module].css` files in the `build/` dir. This is
  a responsive roll-up of everything, non-minified. Note: does not contain responsive grids with @media queries.

- `pure-min.css`: Minified version of `pure.css` that should be used in
  production.

- `pure-nr.css`: A Rollup of all modules without @media queries. This is a
  non-responsive roll-up of everything, non-minified.

- `pure-nr-min.css`: Minified version of `pure-nr.css` that should be used in
  production.

- `grids-responsive.css`: Unminified version of Pure's grid stylesheet which
  includes @media queries.

- `grids-responsive-min.css`: Minified version of `grids-responsive.css` that
  should be used in production.
